# twttr-ops

High-level companion to [`twttr`](https://github.com/chbrown/twttr).

Mishmash of helpers layered on top of `twttr.api/*` calls, for handling pagination, hydration, crawling, etc.

Not yet organized in any stable way, much less published to Clojars, but the functions in [`twttr.ops`](src/twttr/ops.clj) might be useful to others.
